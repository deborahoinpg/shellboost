# ShellBoost

ShellBoost is a Python application designed to customize and enhance the Windows graphical user interface for improved usability. It allows users to change the desktop wallpaper, toggle taskbar visibility, and provides a placeholder for changing the start menu color.

## Features

- **Change Desktop Wallpaper:** Easily change your desktop wallpaper by providing the path to the image file.
- **Toggle Taskbar Visibility:** Show or hide the Windows taskbar at your convenience.
- **Placeholder for Start Menu Color Change:** An example placeholder for changing the start menu color, illustrating how further customization could be implemented.

## Installation

To use ShellBoost, ensure you have Python installed on your Windows machine. Download the `shellboost.py` script or clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shellboost.git
cd shellboost
```

## Usage

Run the script using the command line. You can modify the script to change the image path or taskbar visibility settings.

```bash
python shellboost.py
```

## Limitations

- **Start Menu Color:** The feature to change the start menu color is a placeholder and not implemented due to the complexity of altering Windows system settings.
- **Operating System:** Currently, ShellBoost is designed to work on Windows operating systems only.
